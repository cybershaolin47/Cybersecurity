# Shellcode Executor

This project is a simple C program that demonstrates how to execute shellcode in a Windows environment. The program allocates memory for the shellcode, copies it into the allocated memory, and then creates a thread to execute it. The shellcode is sourced from the Metasploit framework and opens a message box with a message.
